3. Order Management Workflows: More detailed descriptions of order management workflows, including order editing, splitting, and merging capabilities, should be included.

4. Tax Calculation: While mentioned briefly in the Localization section, a more comprehensive tax calculation and management system should be detailed, including support for various tax rules and integrations with tax calculation services.

5. Abandoned Cart Recovery: Although mentioned in the Shopping Cart section, a more detailed description of abandoned cart recovery features and automated email notifications should be provided.

6. SEO Tools: The PRD should include built-in SEO tools for optimizing product pages, meta tags, and generating sitemaps.

7. Review and Rating System: A feature for customers to leave product reviews and ratings, along with moderation capabilities for store owners, should be included.

8. Wishlist Functionality: The ability for customers to create and manage wishlists should be added to the customer-facing features.

9. Gift Cards and Store Credit: Support for selling and redeeming gift cards, as well as managing store credit, should be detailed in the payment processing section.
