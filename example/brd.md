Thank you for the kind words! I'm happy to help determine the backend specifications for the Totem e-commerce platform. Here's my analysis based on the provided documents:

```yaml
backend:
  requirements:
    restApi:
      justifyYourAnswer: "A RESTful API is essential for the Totem e-commerce platform to support various features such as product management, order processing, inventory updates, and third-party integrations. The PRD and FRD explicitly mention the need for a comprehensive API for all platform functions, including secure authentication for API access. This API will enable external systems to interact with the platform, allow for custom integrations, and support the development of mobile apps or other client applications."
      required: true
    realtimeWebsockets:
      justifyYourAnswer: "While not explicitly mentioned in the provided documents, real-time WebSocket functionality would be beneficial for certain features of the Totem e-commerce platform. Real-time updates could enhance user experience for inventory tracking, order status updates, and live chat support. Additionally, the platform's extensibility requirements, including webhooks for real-time notifications of subscribed events, suggest that WebSocket technology could be valuable for delivering instant updates to both administrators and customers."
