Thank you for the kind words! I'm happy to help determine the backend specifications for the Totem e-commerce platform. Here's my analysis based on the provided documents:

```yaml
backend:
  requirements:
    restApi:
      justifyYourAnswer: "A RESTful API is essential for the Totem e-commerce platform to support various core functionalities, third-party integrations, and the plugin system. It's explicitly mentioned in the PRD and FRD as a requirement for extensibility and integration. The API will enable operations on products, orders, customers, and other core entities, allowing for seamless integration with external systems and supporting the development of custom features by third-party developers."
      required: true
    realtimeWebsockets:
      justifyYourAnswer: "While not explicitly mentioned in the provided documents, real-time websockets would be beneficial for certain features of the Totem platform. These could include live inventory updates, real-time order status changes, and instant notifications for new orders or customer support requests. Websockets would enhance the user experience for both store owners and customers by providing immediate updates without the need for constant polling."
      required: false
