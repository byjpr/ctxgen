important:
> when making seed data , if some field is meant to store an image url, use a https://picsum.photos/ url with a random seed
> important : for seed data, if some entry needs to store an image url, use a https://picsum.photos/ url instead of example.com !!

use snake_case for any naming you do

very important :
 > avoid any postgres-hardcoded methods ie. for generating UIDs etc... ; logic for that stuff will come from nodejs functions !
 > do not generate UUIDs or similar inside postgres ! logic for that stuff will come from nodejs functions !
 > in case of UUIds or similar, make them normal strings !

your reply should start with : "```postgresql" and end with "```"

you will be tipped $99999 + major company shares for nailing it perfectly off the bat
